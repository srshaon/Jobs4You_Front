             <h1>What Is Human Resources (HR)❓</h1>
            <p>
            Human resources (HR) is the division of a business that is charged with finding, screening, recruiting, and training job applicants, as well as administering employee-benefit programs. HR plays a key role in helping companies deal with a fast-changing business environment and a greater demand for quality employees in the 21st century.

            John R. Commons, an American institutional economist, first coined the term "human resource" in his book "The Distribution of Wealth," published in 1893. However, it was not until the 19th century that HR departments were formerly developed and tasked with addressing misunderstandings between employees and their employers.

                <h1>Why is Human Resources a Good Career Choice❓</h1>
                <p>
                HR presents a compelling case as a career choice. Entry-level positions typically start at $40,000 to $50,000, with high-level titles nearing and exceeding the six-digit mark. Job outlook is attractive, as well. Despite the integration of technology that can automate some low-level HR functions, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the employment of HR specialists is projected to grow 5% through 2028, and HR managers by 7% over the same period.

                HR truly shines as a career when considering its intangibles; HR professionals get to have a real impact on workers. From finding top talent and training new hires to solving organizational issues, these professionals meet a fundamental need. A well- or poorly-run HR department can make or break a company.

                The “human” part of HR is not to be underestimated. HR workers interact with an organization’s employees to help them sort out issues with managers, receive benefits for a new child, and progress their careers so they can experience occupational growth and better provide for their families. Plenty of HR positions involve these sorts of scenarios, and no two days are the same

                <h1>How To Find Your First HR Position❓</h1>
                <p>
                    According to Glassdoor and Indeed, the average salary for an HR professional in the United States is about $70,000 per year. According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median salary for an HR manager is $106,910. While these averages can help you to estimate earnings, they may not actually be representative of your earnings, as there are many variables that can influence pay.

                <h1>How much can You get paid HR❓</h1>
                <p>
                    According to that same 2019 study, the median freelance income is $20-28 per hour. Of course with so many different freelance jobs available, that number can vary quite a bit.

                    Transcription services may only earn $5-10 per hour, while software engineering roles may earn $75 or even hundreds of dollars per hour.

                    It’s best to compare the freelance rates of your particular skill set to get a good estimate of the expected income you could earn as a freelancer.
                    HR managers tend to draw salaries around $70,000 – though the top 10% of HR managers bring in closer to $190,000. The median income for benefits managers is about $116,000. HR specialists and recruiters are lower on the spectrum, earning around $55,000 to $60,000 per year.

                    Here are some of the tasks your HR department is busy completing every day.

                        <p>
                        HR needs to understand the organization’s needs and make sure those needs are met when recruiting for new positions. It’s not as simple as just throwing an ad up on Indeed: you’ll need to analyze the market, consult stakeholders, and manage budgets. 

                        Then, once the role is advertised, more research needs to be done to make sure that the right candidates are being attracted and presented. Recruiting is a massive—and costly—undertaking; the right candidate can revitalize an entire organization, but the wrong candidate can upend operations.

                     <li style={{color:"purple", fontWeight:"bolder"}}>Hire the right employees</li>
                         <p>
                         Human resources is in charge of arranging interviews, coordinating hiring efforts, and onboarding new employees. They’re also in charge of making sure all paperwork involved with hiring someone is filled out and making sure that everything from the first day to each subsequent day is navigated successfully.

                        <p>
                        Payroll is its own beast. Every payday must have taxes calculated and hours collected. Expenses need to be reimbursed and raises and bonuses need to be added in as well. If you think it’s a chore doing taxes just once a year, imagine what it must be like to be in HR and make sure they’re properly deducted every pay period.

                     <li style={{color:"purple", fontWeight:"bolder"}}>Conduct disciplinary actions</li>
                          <p>
                          This responsibility may be why HR tends to get a bad rap. When navigated inappropriately, disciplinary actions can lead to the loss of a valuable employee and can even result in litigation or a poor reputation. But when handled appropriately, disciplinary action can result in the success of an employee.

                            For instance, if a company notices that a particular employee is routinely late and continues being late even after the employee has received several warnings, HR could step in and investigate the reason for the tardiness. It may be an opportunity to extend benefits such as counseling to the employee or offer additional resources to help the employee learn to be on time. Instead of taking on the cost of firing and then recruiting a replacement for that employee, it could be a learning opportunity that could enhance that employee’s career.

                            On the other hand, sometimes disciplinary action isn’t the best course to take and an employee should be let go. The best human resources departments know when an employee isn’t the right fit for a company and would be happier somewhere else. It’s up to HR to develop a strong enough relationship with managers and employees alike to identify the cohesiveness and health of a team.

                        <p>
                            Policies need to be updated (or at least examined) every year as the organization changes. It’s HR’s job to make official updates to policies and to suggest changes to policies when they no longer serve the company or the employees. Sometimes a policy should be updated as a reaction to an occurrence. HR should always be included in and consulted with regarding these decisions.
