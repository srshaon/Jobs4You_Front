                Applicants interested in going into banking should have at least a high school diploma or a GED for most entry-level positions. A college degree in accounting, finance, business, communications, economics, marketing or computer science will assist the job applicant not only when initially hired, but also when seeking promotions within the banking industry.

                Banks offer many job duties and career path options. Most banking firms offer excellent benefits, including medical insurance and disability insurance, sick leave and vacation, and retirement options. Banking firms are highly regulated and supervised financial operations, making them safe, pleasant and rewarding places to work. These careers offer integrity and stability.

                There are many opportunities to broaden your knowledge and skills at a bank. Most banks offer on-the-job training and encourage you to further your education through a variety of courses, seminars and training programs.
