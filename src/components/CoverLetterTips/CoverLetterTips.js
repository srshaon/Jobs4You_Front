                <h5>➤ What the Experts Say</h5>
                <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
                  The answer is almost always yes. Sure, there will be times
                  when you’re submitting an application online and you may not
                  be able to include one but whenever possible, send one, says
                  Jodi Glickman, a communications expert and author of Great on
                  the Job. “It’s your best chance of getting the attention of
                  the HR person or hiring manager and an important opportunity
                  to distinguish yourself from everyone else.” And in a tight
                  job market, setting yourself apart is critical, says John
                  Lees, a UK-based career strategist and author of Knockout CV.
                  Still, as anyone who’s ever written a cover letter knows, it’s
                  not easy to do well. Here are some tips to help.
                </p>
                <h5>➤ Do your research first</h5>
                <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
                  Before you start writing, find out more about the company and
                  the specific job you want. Of course, you should carefully
                  read the job description, but also peruse the company’s
                  website, its executives’ Twitter feeds, and employee profiles
                  on LinkedIn. This research will help you customize your cover
                  letter, since you shouldn’t send a generic one. It’ll also
                  help you decide on the right tone. “Think about the culture of
                  the organization you’re applying to,” advises Glickman. “If
                  it’s a creative agency, like a design shop, you might take
                  more risks but if it’s a more conservative organization, like
                  a bank, you may hold back.” If at all possible, reach out to
                  the hiring manager or someone else you know at the company
                  before writing your cover letter, advises Lees. You can send
                  an email or a LinkedIn message “asking a smart question about
                  the job.” That way you can start your letter by referencing
                  the interaction. You might say, “Thanks for the helpful
                  conversation last week” or “I recently spoke to so-and-so at
                  your company.” Of course, it’s not always possible to contact
                  someone — or you may not get a response. That’s OK. It’s still
                  worth a try.
                </p>
                <h5>➤ Focus it on the future</h5>
                <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
                  While your résumé is meant to be a lookback at your experience
                  and where you’ve been, the cover letter should focus on the
                  future and what you want to do, says Glickman. “It can be
                  helpful to think of it as the bridge between the past and the
                  future that explains what you hope to do next and why.”
                  Because of the pandemic there is less of an expectation that
                  you’ll be applying for a job that you’ve done before. “There
                  are millions of people who are making career changes —
                  voluntarily or involuntarily — and need to pivot and rethink
                  how their skillset relates to a different role or industry,”
                  says Glickman. You can use your cover letter to explain the
                  shift you’re making, perhaps from hospitality to marketing,
                  for example. Think of it as an opportunity to sell your
                  transferrable skills.
                </p>
                <h5>➤ Open strong</h5>
                <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
                  “People typically write themselves into the letter with ‘I’m
                  applying for X job that I saw in Y place.’ That’s a waste,”
                  says Lees. Instead, lead with a strong opening sentence.
                  “Start with the punch line — why this job is exciting to you
                  and what you bring to the table,” says Glickman. For example,
                  you might write, “I’m an environmental fundraising
                  professional with more than 15 years of experience looking for
                  an opportunity to apply my skills in new ways, and I’d love to
                  bring my expertise and enthusiasm to your growing development
                  team.” Then you can include a sentence or two about your
                  background and your relevant experience but don’t rehash your
                  résumé. Chances are the hiring manager or recruiter is reading
                  a stack of these, so you want to catch their attention. But
                  don’t try to be funny. “Humor can often fall flat or sound
                  self-regarding,” says Lees. Stay away from common platitudes,
                  too. “Say something direct and dynamic, such as ‘Let me draw
                  your attention to two reasons why I’d be a great addition to
                  your team.'” If you have a personal connection with the
                  company or someone who works there, also mention it in the
                  first sentence or two. And always address your letter to
                  someone directly. “With social media, it’s often possible to
                  find the name of a hiring manager,” says Glickman.
                </p>
                <h5>➤ Emphasize your personal value</h5>
                <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
                  Hiring managers are looking for people who can help them solve
                  problems. Drawing on the research you did earlier, show that
                  you know what the company does and some of the challenges it
                  faces. These don’t need to be specific but you might mention
                  how the industry has been affected by the pandemic. For
                  example, you might write, “A lot of healthcare companies are
                  overwhelmed with the need to provide high quality care while
                  protecting the health and safety of their staff.” Then talk
                  about how your experience has equipped you to meet those
                  needs; perhaps explain how you solved a similar problem in the
                  past or share a relevant accomplishment. You want to provide
                  evidence of the things that set you apart. Lees points out
                  that there are two skills that are relevant to almost any job
                  right now: adaptability and the ability to learn quickly. If
                  you have brief examples that demonstrate these skills include
                  those. For example, if you supported your team in the shift to
                  remote work, describe how you did that and what capabilities
                  you drew on.
                </p>
                <h5>➤ Watch the tone</h5>
                <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
                  At the same time, don’t go overboard with the flattery or say
                  anything you don’t mean. Authenticity is crucial. “Even if
                  you’ve been out of work for months, and would take any job at
                  this point, you want to avoid sounding desperate,” says Lees.
                  You don’t want your tone to undermine your message so be
                  professional and mature. A good rule of thumb is to put
                  yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager and think about
                  “the kind of language that the hiring manager would use with
                  one of the company’s customers.” Of course, it can be hard to
                  discern your own tone in writing so you may need to ask
                  someone to review a draft (which is always a good idea anyway
                  — see advice below). Lees says that he often cuts outs
                  “anything that sounds like desperation” when he’s reviewing
                  letters for clients.
                </p>
                <h5>➤ Get feedback</h5>
                <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
                  In fact, it’s a great idea to share your cover letter with a
                  few people, says Lees. Rather than sending it off and asking,
                  “What do you think?” be specific about the kind of feedback
                  you want. In particular, request two things. First, ask your
                  friend if it’s clear what your main point is. What’s the story
                  you’re telling? Are they able to summarize it? Second, ask
                  them what’s wrong with the letter. “Other people are more
                  attuned to desperation, overselling, over-modesty, and
                  underselling,” says Lees and they should be able to point out
                  places where the tone is off.
                </p>
                <h5>➤ When you can’t submit a cover letter</h5>
                <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
                  Many companies now use online application systems that don’t
                  allow for a cover letter. You may be able to figure out how to
                  include one in the same document as your résumé but that’s not
                  a guarantee, especially because some systems only allow for
                  data to be entered into specific boxes. In these cases, use
                  the format you’re given to demonstrate your ability to do the
                  job and your enthusiasm for the role. If possible, you may try
                  to find someone who you can send a brief follow-up email
                  highlighting a few key points about your application.
