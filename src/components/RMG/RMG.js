             <h1>How the wage is❓</h1>
             <p>
                The wage of Garments sector (although under discussion) still is less than the corporate character. Most of the corporate garments or apparel firms argued that they are paying a bit higher salary to their workers. Now, there are two sections within a company. The ones who are working in the production line, and the ones who are running the management. There is no actual measuring standard scale to count the difference between the two employee's salaries. The salary structure of the product line workers is a whole different issue. For the management, salary range is pretty high and satisfactory. Sadly, the highly paid positions are for people with 10-15 years of experience. So, there is less chance for the fresh graduates to get in there at the very beginning. They can eventually get there for sure. But it doesn't work like magic at all. To summarize, the fresh graduates need to be patient in order to get there. They will probably have to walk past the lucrative MNC salary structure at the beginning of their career. Well, it's not always about the salary you withdraw. In this sector, you are investing your time to get better, to be irreplaceable, only if you don't give up in the first few years that is.

While connecting to the professionals already working in the sector, they should have the idea to about the field.” He also added, “There is a huge need of talent and the young generation in this field.” Because of the unwillingness of the recent generation in the industry, people are hired to work.
